Let me quickly go over the course materials.

You should see an attachment under this lecture.

Please download and unzip the file.

It contains all the examples used in the course. You should see four directories.

libs folder contains all the libraries needed.

assets folder contains all the assets, including 3D models, images, videos, etc..

lectures folder contains all the completed source code at the end of each lecture.

lectures-start, on the other hand, contains the source code at the beginning of each lecture

for each lecture,

I suggest you to open the corresponding source code in the lectures-start

and follow along while watching the video.

If you have any problems.

Open the one in the Lectures folder for reference.

There is a README file that contains all the mapping between lectures and source code.

for any lectures that do not have source code, you can just relax and listen.

That will be all.
